## Description
Demostracting a shift cipher logic base on user input.

## Example
Given the keyword ‘ET’ and the original message ‘IXL’, the first character ‘I’ would
be encoded with a Caesar cipher of offset 4 (corresponding to ‘E’ in the keyword), the ‘X’
would be encoded with a Caesar cipher of offset 19 (from ‘T’ in the keyword), and the final
letter ‘L’ would be encoded with a Caesar cipher of offset 4 (looped back to ‘E’ in the keyword).
This cyclic use of the keyword may be visualized with the following diagram:
